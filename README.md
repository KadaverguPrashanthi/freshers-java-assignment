Persons can shop if there is availability of cart/. So number who will shop is always less than or equal to available carts. Again i wrote the code for each person by each item. For this I used for loop. A person can take the number of item less than or equal to available number of items. for this I used if loop. Cost of the items can calculated by the formula. People may or may not take the total items added to to cart. So final cost can be uptained by subtracting the removed items from total item. after shopping persons leave the shop. Now total number of items number of persons decreases. this value again gives to starting position. Switch statement is used to print the  any value.
